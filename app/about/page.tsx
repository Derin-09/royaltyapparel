  <p className="text-xl  font-body leading-relaxed mb-6">
   I&apos;m a fashion stylist who pulls from African textures and everyday street energy, blending them with clean, modern cuts. My work is just how I see people: bold, expressive, and tired of boring outfits pretending to be personality.
  </p>

  <p className="text-xl /80 font-body leading-relaxed mb-6">
  I work across editorials, personal branding, events, and anywhere style needs a little backbone. I focus on structure, color, and the kind of details most people overlook until the photo hits them in the face.
  </p>

  <p className="text-xl /80 font-body leading-relaxed">
  I&apos;m not here to recreate trends. I&apos;m here to build looks that feel familiar, rooted, and still fresh enough to stand in any room without shrinking. The whole point is about style that nods to where we come from but isn&apos;t scared to evolve.
